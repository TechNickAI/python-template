# Handoff Context

<objective>
Generate a comprehensive context handoff for the current conversation that can be copied and pasted to continue work in a new session.
</objective>

<execution>
Create handoff following the XML-structured format, save to timestamped temp file, copy to clipboard automatically. Show brief confirmation: `📋 Copied to clipboard`

Do not ask for permission - execute immediately.
</execution>

<handoff-format>
```markdown
# Context Handoff

<context_handoff>
<original_task> [State the original, specific request or task] </original_task>
<work_completed> [List everything successfully accomplished with file paths and line numbers] </work_completed>
<work_remaining> [Detail work that still needs to be done with priorities] </work_remaining>
<attempted_approaches> [Document approaches that didn't work and why] </attempted_approaches>
<critical_context> [Preserve essential technical, project, and business context] </critical_context>
<current_state> [Describe exact state of deliverables and system] </current_state>
<recommendations> [Provide actionable next steps in priority order] </recommendations>
</context_handoff>
```
</handoff-format>

<implementation>
Get timestamp with `date +%s`, use Write tool to save to `/tmp/context_handoff_[timestamp].md`, run `pbcopy < /tmp/context_handoff_[timestamp].md`, show confirmation.

Why Write tool: Avoids git hooks, no escaping issues, faster execution, prevents collisions.
</implementation>

<quality-guidelines>
For clean copy/paste: Start with `# Context Handoff`, end with `</context_handoff>`, no preambles or summaries.

For comprehensive documentation: Include file paths with line numbers, document all work including minor changes, include failed attempts, preserve error messages and stack traces, note time-sensitive information, include git status and branch info.
</quality-guidelines>

<success-criteria>
Handoff should be immediately pasteable into new Claude conversation. New Claude instance should be able to continue work without additional context.
</success-criteria>
