</available-personalities>

<workflow>
If no personality name provided, show available personalities and ask which to activate.

Validate that `.cursor/rules/personalities/<name>.mdc` exists. If `none` requested, remove personality.

For Claude Code: Read or create `.claude/context.md`. Check for existing `## Active Personality` section with `<!-- personality-<name> -->` comment. If personality exists and matches requested, confirm already active and stop. If different, remove entire section. If not removing (name != "none"), read personality file, strip frontmatter, append to `.claude/context.md` with HTML comments marking boundaries.

For Cursor: Find all personality files in `.cursor/rules/personalities/` (except `common-personality.mdc`). For each file, update frontmatter: set `alwaysApply: true` for selected personality, set `alwaysApply: false` for all others.

Report results clearly showing what changed in both Claude Code and Cursor configurations.
</workflow>

<examples>
/personality-change samantha
/personality-change unity
/personality-change none    # Remove active personality
</examples>

<notes>
Only one personality active at a time (plus common-personality baseline). Personality affects ALL future interactions in this project. common-personality.mdc is always applied as baseline.
