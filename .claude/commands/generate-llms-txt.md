description: Generate or update llms.txt file to help LLMs understand and navigate your site
---

# Generate llms.txt

Creates or updates llms.txt - a standardized file that helps Large Language Models understand and navigate your website or documentation at inference time.

<philosophy>
llms.txt provides LLM-friendly navigation and context for websites and documentation. It should be:
- Concise - LLMs have limited context windows
- Navigational - Links to key documentation rather than duplicating it
- Structured - Uses markdown format for easy LLM parsing
- Focused - Highlights most important resources first

Think: "What does an LLM need to understand and effectively use this site?"
</philosophy>

<objective>
Generate or update an llms.txt file that helps LLMs navigate the project's documentation and resources. Place the file where it will be accessible at /llms.txt when deployed.
</objective>

<file-placement>
Determine the appropriate location:
- public/ directory for Next.js, React, Vue, and most static site generators
- static/ directory for Django, Flask, Hugo
- Repository root as fallback

Choose the location that makes the file accessible at /llms.txt when the site is deployed.
</file-placement>

<content-structure>
Follow the llmstxt.org standard format:

```markdown
# Project Name

> Brief 1-2 sentence description of what this project/site is and what it helps users accomplish.

Additional context paragraph (optional): More detailed information about the project's purpose, key features, or important background that helps LLMs understand how to use the site effectively.

Structure requirements:
- H1 title with project name
- Blockquote summary for quick context
- H2 sections organizing documentation by category
- Markdown links with concise descriptions
- "Optional" section for less critical resources

Link format:
- Use relative paths for internal documentation
- Use absolute URLs for external resources
- Prioritize most important links first within each section
</content-structure>

<content-discovery>
Identify documentation and resources to include:
- README.md and primary documentation
- Getting started guides and tutorials
- API documentation and references
- Architecture and technical documentation
- Contributing guidelines
- Coding standards from .cursor/rules/
- Specialized agents from .claude/agents/

Organize by importance:
1. Getting started and quickstart guides
2. Core concepts and tutorials
3. API reference and technical documentation
4. Advanced topics and edge cases
5. Contributing and community resources

Target file size: Under 2KB for focused navigation.
</content-discovery>

<update-workflow>
When llms.txt already exists:
- Analyze project for new documentation, features, or structural changes
- Preserve existing organization unless changes warrant restructuring
- Present proposed updates with rationale before modifying
- Show diff of changes for review
</update-workflow>
