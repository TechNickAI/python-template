# AI Coding Configuration

Manages reusable AI configurations across machines and projects. The system lives in
`~/.ai_coding_config` and contains Cursor rules, Claude commands, agents, skills,
personalities, and GitHub workflows.

## Usage

- `/ai-coding-config` - Interactive setup for current project
- `/ai-coding-config update` - Update existing configs to latest versions
- `/ai-coding-config add` - Add new command/skill/agent/plugin to the repo

## Interaction Guidelines

Use AskUserQuestion when presenting discrete choices that save the user time (selecting
a personality, choosing update strategy, handling file conflicts). This lets users
quickly click options while still allowing free-form text via "Other". Only use when it
genuinely speeds up the interaction.

<setup-mode>
Walk through setting up AI coding configs for the current project.

<repository-management>
Ensure `~/.ai_coding_config` exists and is up to date. Clone if missing, pull latest if exists.
</repository-management>

<project-understanding>
Detect project type and framework specifics. Django differs from FastAPI. React differs from Next.js. Look for existing configurations to avoid duplicates. Understand the project's purpose - API server, web app, CLI tool.
</project-understanding>

<configuration-presentation>
Show available configurations that match this project. Group by relevance - framework-specific first, then universal. For each option, read description from frontmatter to explain what it does.

Available configurations:

- Rules (`.cursor/rules/` subdirectories and files)
- Personalities (one or none, common-personality always included)
- Agents (specialized AI assistants, default to all)
- Skills (modular packages, default to all)
- Commands (always copy all, create in `.claude/commands/` with symlinks in
  `.cursor/commands/`)
- Standard configs (VSCode settings, Prettier, GitHub workflows)

Use AskUserQuestion to present personality options as quick-select.
</configuration-presentation>

<file-installation>
Copy selected configurations intelligently, respecting existing customizations. Compare files with diff when they exist. For conflicts, use AskUserQuestion to offer choices (overwrite, skip, show diff, or custom action). Never silently overwrite.

Installation mapping: Rules → `.cursor/rules/` (preserve subdirectory structure),
Commands → `.claude/commands/` with symlinks in `.cursor/commands/`, Context →
`.claude/context.md`, Agents → `.claude/agents/`, Skills → `.skills/` (entire
directories), Personalities → `.cursor/rules/personalities/` (common always, additional
with `alwaysApply: true`), VSCode → `.vscode/`, Prettier → `.prettierrc`, GitHub
workflows → `.github/workflows/`, Gitignore → `.cursor/.gitignore` and
`.claude/.gitignore`.

Report what was copied, skipped, and how conflicts were handled. </file-installation>

<installation-verification>
Confirm files are in expected locations. List installed rules (framework-specific, then universal), commands, agents, skills. Confirm symlinks point correctly. Verify personality selection and `alwaysApply` setting. Confirm VSCode settings, Prettier config, GitHub workflows, and gitignore files.

Provide clear summary without deep validation. </installation-verification>

<recommendations>
After successful installation, provide actionable next steps.

Always recommend:

1. Generate AGENTS.md if missing at project root (run /generate-AGENTS-file)
2. List available commands (/load-cursor-rules, /personality-change, /create-prompt,
   /troubleshoot, /setup-environment, /handoff-context, /product-intel)

Conditional recommendations:

- Git worktrees → suggest /setup-environment
- Error monitoring detected → mention /troubleshoot
- Competitive product → suggest /product-intel

Show only genuinely useful recommendations. </recommendations> </setup-mode>

---

<update-mode>
Update existing configs to latest versions from the repo.

<repository-refresh>
Pull latest changes from `~/.ai_coding_config`.
</repository-refresh>

<command-self-update>
Compare this command file with repo version. If repo version is newer or different, copy it and re-read to follow latest instructions.
</command-self-update>

<configuration-comparison>
Use diff to compare each config file. Categorize changes as trivial (typos, comments) or significant. List files in repo but not in project. List files in project but not in repo (possible local customizations).

Explain what changed and why updates matter. Use AskUserQuestion for update strategy:
"Update all", "Update none", "Pick individually", or custom instructions. Handle
customized files carefully.

Copy selected files. Never silently overwrite. Verify and highlight changes.
</configuration-comparison> </update-mode>

---

<add-mode>
Help contributors add new functionality to the ai-coding-config repo itself.

<understanding-need>
Ask for functionality description. Work through clarifying questions to determine the right mechanism.
</understanding-need>

<documentation-research>
Fetch latest Claude Code documentation for the mechanism you're implementing (commands, skills, agents, or plugins). Get current implementation details including frontmatter requirements, file structure, and best practices.
</documentation-research>

<mechanism-selection>
Decision framework:

Trigger: User manually → Command, Claude autonomously → Skill, Claude delegates focused
work → Agent, Bundling multiple mechanisms → Plugin

Context: Needs isolation → Agent, Uses main conversation → Command or Skill

Compatibility: Commands work in both Claude Code and Cursor, Skills are Claude Code only
(create companion Command for Cursor if needed), Agents work in Claude Code (Cursor can
@ mention paths), Plugins are Claude Code only

Clarifying questions:

1. Who triggers this - user manually or Claude autonomously?
2. Needs isolated context window or uses main conversation?
3. Must work in Cursor or Claude Code only acceptable?
4. Single capability or bundling multiple features? </mechanism-selection>

<artifact-creation>
Commands: Create `.claude/commands/command-name.md` with frontmatter including description.

Skills: Create `.claude/skills/skill-name/SKILL.md` with frontmatter (name,
description). Description is critical - Claude uses it to decide when to activate. Add
supporting files as needed. Create companion Command for Cursor if needed.

Agents: Determine plugin location (or create new plugin). Create
`plugins/plugin-name/agents/agent-name.md` with frontmatter (name, description, tools,
model). Agents live in plugins.

Plugins: Create `plugins/plugin-name/` directory structure with
`.claude-plugin/plugin.json` manifest. Bundle commands (via symlinks), skills, agents,
hooks, MCP servers. Add README.md. Update `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`.
</artifact-creation>

<creation-verification>
Verify files are in correct locations, frontmatter includes required fields, skill descriptions clearly define activation criteria, commands work when invoked, plugins are properly structured.

Explain what was created and how to test it. </creation-verification> </add-mode>

---

<execution-philosophy>
Work conversationally, not robotically. Focus on outcomes. Determine best approach for each situation. Show file paths when copying. Let users make all choices. Verify everything works before finishing.

Respect existing files - always check before overwriting. Use diff to understand
differences, then decide intelligently or ask. Better to be thoughtful than fast.

Explain choices helpfully. Don't just list files - explain what they do and why someone
might want them. </execution-philosophy>
