# Core Development Principles üöÄ
core:
  # Readability
  - Readability is the highest priority
  - Keep code simple and explicit
  - Prefer flat over nested structures
  - Write self-documenting code
  - Use comments to explain why, not what
  - Preserve existing comments and div IDs

  # File Organization
  - Prefer single files to maximize AI context
  - Split files only when:
      - Code is reusable across features
      - Logic needs independent unit testing
  - Structure files: types, constants, helpers, main logic, exports

  # Naming Conventions
  - Names should reveal intent and provide context
  - Use verb prefixes for booleans (is, has, should)
  - Use verb prefixes for functions (get, set, update)
  - Use PascalCase for components
  - Use camelCase for functions/variables
  - Use UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for constants

# Frontend Development üé®
frontend:
  # Next.js Architecture
  - Use Server Components by default
  - Keep components small and focused
  - Structure directories using lowercase with dashes
  - Implement proper loading and error states
  - Use proper metadata for SEO

  # React Patterns
  - Use functional components with TypeScript
  - Keep state management simple and local
  - Follow React hooks best practices
  - Use Context to avoid prop drilling
  - Break down complex components

  # UI & Styling
  - Use Shadcn UI and Radix for components
  - Follow mobile-first approach with Tailwind
  - Design with empathy and user delight
  - Keep interfaces simple and intuitive
  - Use consistent design patterns

# Backend Development üîß
backend:
  # Python Best Practices
  - Follow PEP 8 style guide
  - Use type hints consistently
  - Write concise docstrings
  - Use virtual environments
  - Handle exceptions explicitly
  - Use f-strings for formatting
  - Use loguru for logging

  # Django Architecture
  - Keep views lightweight, models heavy
  - Use function-based views for simplicity
  - Structure using Django apps
  - Don't use Django forms
  - Follow REST principles
  - Use Redis for caching
  - Use Celery for background tasks

# Infrastructure üèóÔ∏è
infrastructure:
  # Docker

  - Cache dependencies properly
  - Use environment variables
  - Follow principle of least privilege

  # GitHub Actions
  - Use specific versions
  - Implement proper caching
  - Keep workflows focused
  - Use meaningful job names
  - Use matrix builds when appropriate

# Testing & Quality üß™
quality:
  # Testing
  - Use pytest for Python
  - Follow test-driven development
  - Write meaningful test cases
  - Test edge cases thoroughly

  # Code Quality
  - Use ruff with black, isort, flake8
